Assets used in this game was given in the class.

So, in this game there is a HomeScreen, CharacterScreen, and BattleScreen, along with a final victory/loss screen to redirect back to HomeScreen at the end. 

UseState was used for the Player and Monster allocation of stats, A reducer was used for the magic stat, and a statnavigator was used to navigate us throughout our screens. The "faking it" method that you told us in class was used in order to make the victory and defeat screen in order to bring us to the start screen.
